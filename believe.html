                        <p style="text-align: left;">Homelander is great at giving speeches! He really knows how to take control and assert his dominance in the face of danger. He understood that he needed to make these people feel safe after a terrorist attack and he demonstrated that he is willing to go fight! Instead of conforming to what Vought wants him to say, Homelander does what's right and speaks his truth, which is something I admire. Homelander understands his role as a protector of America but he is restricted by the government and by Vought to do what he believes is right! But Homelander doesn't let those feelings go away and he speaks his truth to these people! The way that Homelander doesn't hold back and knows what is right and wrong is so amazing!</p>
