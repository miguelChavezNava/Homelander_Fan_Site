                        <p style="text-align: left;">Homelander really stands up for himself in this scene. He was just personally attacked by someone in the audience on his birthday. He has every right to be angry as he had been through a lot with his girlfriend harming herself. But, in spite of this anger, he demonstrates his independence and how he's done being controlled! The way he stands up to Vought and all of the billionaires that control him really inspire me to want to do the same. Our government really is controlling and I am sick and tired of being brainwashed by the fake news and leftists. Homelander understands his values and strengths and doesn't let others take advantage of him! It really is inspiring!</p>
