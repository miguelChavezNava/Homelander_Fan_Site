                        <p style="text-align: left;">Although this clip doesn't show Homelander in the best light, it highlights values he holds that I admire. Homelander has the strength to confront his son about lying to where he is going. His son goes to see someone who acts like a father to him, but he is someone who wants to kill his father! Understandably, Homelander is upset about this and confronts his son. Homelander tries his best for his son and he doesn't get the respect that he deserves! A son should never lie or go behind the back of their father. Homelander clearly cares about his son if he is willing to be so vulnerable with him. Yeah, he overreacted a little bit, but he has every right to be mad at his son for lying to him. Homelander is just trying to do his best for his son and that is something that I applaud him for.</p>
