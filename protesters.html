                        <p style="text-align: left;">Homelander had every right to use force against that man. I mean, that stupid protester literally attacked his son! Any man in their right mind would retaliate against an attack on their family! Homelander went out of his way to come to the people who support him and show them his son, someone dear to him, and all he gets is hate from the other side! That protester had no respect for anything if he was willing to harm Homelander's son like that! I'm so glad that the crowd supported his actions because it is great to see Homelander backed in his decisions. If someone attacked my son, I know I'd do something about that and I admire that about Homelander!</p>
